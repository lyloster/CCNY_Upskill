One should crave more of the adventures in the books to come and wait for the happy end for the Baudelaire children. <br/>Now that I've read the book and not being a 10-year-old, I can see the huge amount of references and the choice of the names of all characters, which I haven't seen before. <br/>This book was a nostalgic reminiscence for me of what kind of books I read when I was little and why I read them, sympathizing with the boy who loved more than anything to read and joining the three protagonists in their adventures.<br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

When I read the book, I felt like the author was trying to find a good argument why subcultures were a good thing and to bring the debate on subcultures on a more sophisticated level - definitely an ambitious thing to do. They are good because they bring innovation with them as almost everything else actually.<br/>Nevertheless, I definitely learned some interesting things from the essays in the book and will recommend it to someone who is looking for an easy-paced read.

It is as if no one knows Sabina’s real name and her real self, neither does she, and no one is able to possess her. This is not a novel about love, but a novel about guilt and redemption, fear of the mundane and paranoia.<br/>I am not exactly sure whether or not I like the book, but it definitely struck me as an honest piece. I didn't like the premise of a mischievous woman cheating constantly on her husband and lovers. Nevertheless, the leitmotiv of trying to find yourself, to reinvent yourself and to make peace with yourself is what I liked the most about the novel.   Although there is a protagonist, Sabina, the author’s voice echoes through the pages. The writing is so fluid and it grabs your attention, so you can’t stop reading. The lack of separation in chapters makes you read incessantly. <br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,
